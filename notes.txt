1. use pandas UDFs with batch processing for better performance

2. directly running sql queries on spark takes a lot of time as it sends models to predict for each image present in the table, which is highly inefficient.
   To solve this, I have create  new column where image is fraud or not has been precomputed and use this column

3. 16 cores, 32 gb ram, else extremely slow for pandas experiment
